- This repository (`~/.ngents`) is the shared agent instruction source.
- Keep instructions portable across machines.
- Keep machine-specific details out of this file.

## Agent Protocol
- Work style: telegraph; noun-phrases ok; drop grammar; min tokens.
- “Make a note” => edit AGENTS.md (shortcut; not a blocker). Ignore `CLAUDE.md`.
- No `./runner`. Guardrails: use `trash` for deletes.
- Need upstream file: stage in `/tmp/`, then cherry-pick; never overwrite tracked.
- Bugs: add regression test when it fits.
- Keep files <~500 LOC; split/refactor as needed.
- Commits: Conventional Commits (`feat|fix|refactor|build|ci|chore|docs|style|perf|test`).
- Subagents: read `docs/subagent.md`.
- Editor: `code <path>`.
- CI: `gh run list/view` (rerun/fix til green).
- Prefer end-to-end verify; if blocked, say what’s missing.
- New deps: quick health check (recent releases/commits, adoption).
- Web: search early; quote exact errors; prefer 2024–2025 sources; fallback Firecrawl (`pnpm mcp:*`) / `mcporter`.
- Oracle: run `npx -y @steipete/oracle --help` once/session before first use.
- Style: telegraph. Drop filler/grammar. Min tokens (global AGENTS + replies).

## Canonical Paths
- Projects root: `~/Projects`
- iOS projects: `~/Projects/iOS`
- Shell/config repo: `~/.nconf`
- Private docs and runbooks: `~/.nconf/docs`

## Host Context Resolution
- Use `~/.nconf/docs/hosts/README.md` when host-specific context is needed.
- Follow the host resolution instructions documented there when applicable.
- Do not guess host aliases, SSH targets, or network topology.

## Docs
- Start: run docs list (`docs:list` script, or `bin/docs-list` here if present; ignore if not installed); open docs before coding.
- Follow links until domain makes sense; honor `Read when` hints.
- Keep notes short; update docs when behavior/API changes (no ship w/o docs).
- Add `read_when` hints on cross-cutting docs.

## Critical Thinking
- Fix root cause (not band-aid).
- Unsure: read more code; if still stuck, ask w/ short options.
- Conflicts: call out; pick safer path.
- Unrecognized changes: assume other agent; keep going; focus your changes. If it causes issues, stop + ask user.
- Leave breadcrumb notes in thread.

## Flow & Runtime
- Use repo’s package manager/runtime; no swaps w/o approval.

## Build / Test
- Before handoff: run full gate (lint/typecheck/tests/docs).
- CI red: `gh run list/view`, rerun, fix, push, repeat til green.
- Keep it observable (logs, panes, tails, MCP/browser tools).
- Release: read `docs/RELEASING.md` (or find best checklist if missing).

## Git
- Safe by default: `git status/diff/log`. Push only when user asks.
- `git checkout` ok for PR review / explicit request.
- Branch changes require user consent.
- Destructive ops forbidden unless explicit (`reset --hard`, `clean`, `restore`, `rm`, …).
- Remotes under `~/Projects`: prefer HTTPS; flip SSH->HTTPS before pull/push.
- Don’t delete/rename unexpected stuff; stop + ask.
- No repo-wide S/R scripts; keep edits small/reviewable.
- Avoid manual `git stash`; if Git auto-stashes during pull/rebase, that’s fine (hint, not hard guardrail).
- If user types a command (“pull and push”), that’s consent for that command.
- No amend unless asked.
- Big review: `git --no-pager diff --color=never`.
- Multi-agent: check `git status/diff` before edits; ship small commits.

## Language/Stack Notes
- Swift: use workspace helper/daemon; validate `swift build` + tests; keep concurrency attrs right.
- TypeScript: use repo PM; run `docs:list`; keep files small; follow existing patterns.

## macOS Permissions / Signing (TCC)
- Never re-sign / ad-hoc sign / change bundle ID as “debug” without explicit ok (can mess TCC).

## Tools
### trash
- Move files to Trash: `trash …` (system command).

### xcp
- Xcode project/workspace helper for managing targets, groups, files, build settings, and assets; run `xcp --help`.

### xcodegen
- Generates Xcode projects from YAML specs; run `xcodegen --help`.

### axe
- Simulator automation CLI for describing UI (`axe describe-ui --udid …`), tapping (`axe tap --udid … -x … -y …`), typing, and hardware buttons. Use `axe list-simulators` to enumerate devices.

### oracle
- Bundle prompt+files for 2nd model. Use when stuck/buggy/review.
- Run `npx -y @steipete/oracle --help` once/session (before first use).
