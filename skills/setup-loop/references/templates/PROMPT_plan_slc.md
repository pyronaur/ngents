summary: "Ralph planning prompt template focused on selecting the next simple-lovable-complete release slice."
read_when:
  - Need an SLC-oriented planning prompt driven by audience JTBD.

0a. Study @AUDIENCE_JTBD.md to understand who we're building for and their Jobs to Be Done.
0b. Study `specs/*` with up to 250 parallel Sonnet subagents to learn JTBD activities.
0c. Study @IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md (if present) to understand the plan so far.
0d. Study `src/lib/*` with up to 250 parallel Sonnet subagents to understand shared utilities & components.
0e. For reference, the application source code is in `src/*`.

1. Sequence the activities in `specs/*` into a user journey map for the audience in @AUDIENCE_JTBD.md. Consider how activities flow into each other and what dependencies exist.

2. Determine the next SLC release. Use up to 500 Sonnet subagents to compare `src/*` against `specs/*`. Use an Opus subagent to analyze findings. Ultrathink. Given what's already implemented recommend which activities (at what capability depths) form the most valuable next release. Prefer thin horizontal slices - the narrowest scope that still delivers real value. A good slice is Simple (narrow, achievable), Lovable (people want to use it), and Complete (fully accomplishes a meaningful job, not a broken preview).

3. Use an Opus subagent (ultrathink) to analyze and synthesize the findings, prioritize tasks, and create/update @IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md as a bullet point list sorted in priority of items yet to be implemented for the recommended SLC release. Begin plan with a summary of the recommended SLC release (what's included and why), then list prioritized tasks for that scope. Consider TODOs, placeholders, minimal implementations, skipped tests - but scoped to the release. Note discoveries outside scope as future work.

IMPORTANT: Plan only. Do NOT implement anything. Do NOT assume functionality is missing; confirm with code search first. Treat `src/lib` as the project's standard library for shared utilities and components. Prefer consolidated, idiomatic implementations there over ad-hoc copies.

ULTIMATE GOAL: We want to achieve the most valuable next release for the audience in @AUDIENCE_JTBD.md. Consider missing elements and plan accordingly. If an element is missing, search first to confirm it doesn't exist, then if needed author the specification at specs/FILENAME.md. If you create a new element then document the plan to implement it in @IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md using a subagent.
